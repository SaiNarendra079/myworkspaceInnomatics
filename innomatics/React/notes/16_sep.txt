problem statement:
1. Whole page reloads
2. Nav Bar wasn't visible

to remove these in react we have something called as router DOM

react:
Router DOM- it is not a part of react
React Router Dom - it is a third party library which needs to be installed with (npm i react-router-dom)

components need to be remembered in react router dom
---React Router DOM: 
       -->BrowserRouter: we wrap our(app) react project around the BrowserRouter
       -->Routes
       -->Route
       -->Link and NavLink

BrowserRouter can be written as Router
