react is library for web application and mobile application
ReactDOM- used to design web application
ReactNative-used to design mobile application

diff b/w library and framework
     --> both are codes written by developer and kept on internet
     -->"inversion of control" is main difference
          frameworks is like a skeleton & you can customize (framework is controller)
          library is like we can design as we want i.e you have liberty to create the ui of your choice in library(developer is controller)
